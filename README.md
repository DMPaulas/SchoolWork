Simple platform school work that was necessary to finish the Health Information Systems lecture.
Basicly it was supposed to be a platform for different doctors in a clinic.
Pacients would come to a consult with a family doctor
By filling a form with some data and symptoms
It would generate a response about the severity of the desease/case
And the person would be recommended to see a specific doctor in the clinic.

This is a very resumed information about the project. It was the main objective.
But it have doctor/pacient registation, doctors could only see some pages, pacients the same. Upload information. Change profile information. Everything is using a database too.
Design was very simple, cause i only had 1/2 months to finish it, while doing other school projects. The code is unfinished, but the main objective was fufilled, i had 16 in 20.
